            <h3>About Me</h3> <hr> <br>
            <p>My name is John Owen, but I go by Johnny, and I started coding in March of 2023.
               This page will showcase the projects I have completed in the past and will be regularly updated as I progress.
               Before coding I mostly worked in the restaurant industry as a chef and held a retail postion for about two and a half years.
               I like to livestream while making fantastic food when I have time.</p>

                            <p>
                                This app was Project 2 for the coding bootcamp I am attending. 
                                We were attempting to recreate a restaurant webpage with a menu, an ordering system for customers, and admin permissions for employe's to edit the menu. 
                                It was pretty ambitious for a 3 week project but we did pretty well. 
                                This was built using Express Sessions and MySQL.

                            <p>
                                This app was built by me for me to help me decide what to make for dinner. 
                                I love cooking but can never choose what to make. 
                                This app has 3 different sections that just give me suggestions pre-loaded into the website. 
                                The ideas section is just suggestions.
                                The recipes, links section gives links to website recipes.
                                The Casson recipes section has links to a google drive folder that my family has access to, so we can look at randomly suggested family recipes.

                            <h4>Horiseon</h4>
                            <p>This was a refactor of already existing code. 
                            I consolidated it and took away any repeating code.
                            The website remained the exact same as when I recieved the code. </p>

                            <h4>Password Generator</h4>
                            <p>This project was one where I recieved HTML and CSS code all ready to go for a password generator.
                                All I had to do was add Javascript logic. This project taught me a lot about JS functions. 
                                You can use this fully functional app to generate random passwords for you to use for an added layer of profile security.
